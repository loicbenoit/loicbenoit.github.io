# What is a solution architect?

A bridge between business and technology. The solution architect leads the practice and establishes the technical vision of a solution for a given business plan. There are many correct ways to build your vision, but finding the best fit for you is my challenge.

- What are your short, medium and long term business goals?
- What challenges should we manage while building your vision?
- Is your budget upfront or will revenues be generated at each stage of the way?
- What is your starting point?
- How will daily operations move toward your vision?
- What can people do to help and prepare?
- Is the organization prepared to adapt practices and governance models? 
- What are your values and market priorities?

> **Focus on what matters**: The right tool produces what you actually want.

> **Keep that ball in the air**: Align your daily operations progressively.

> **Promote user satisfaction**: Help the team and the organization adapt proactively.

My first step is getting a clear understanding of your business objectives, challenges, market and organization. The best technology fit for your budget must include everyone and everything in scope. I cultivate collaboration, team spirit and best practices to deliver quality and efficient results.

I'm central when planning the various projects that deliver your vision. I'm hands-on when a team jumpstarts a project and delivers a proof of concept. I actively support project managers and professional teams while they work on delivering projects. I handle escalations and find workarounds to keep everyone moving forward, as delivering your vision successfully is my responsibility.

# Background

My abilities as a solution architect and programmer are the fruit of 20 years of experience in I.T. for clients and projects of various sizes in retail, B2B, B2C, online marketing, translation and inventory control, in both the private and the public sectors. 

As a full stack programmer, my experience encompasses both the frontend (design, marketing, usability, translation, HTML-CSS-JS coding and business logic) and the backend (servers, databases, code management, business logic, Python3-PHP-JS-Bash).

Speaking business fluently and having good people skill was a requirement as a small business entrepreneur. Navigating the politics of a big company as a large-scale marketing production manager made me grow fast, both professionally and in life. As a technical translator, I practiced daily the art of putting myself in another person's shoes. Forming healthy professional relationships is such an important skill when leading and motivating team members toward a common goal.
